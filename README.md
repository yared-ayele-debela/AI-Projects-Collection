### 2 🤖 AI Email & Message Rewriter

Overview
The AI Email & Message Rewriter is a modern micro-SaaS application designed to instantly transform the tone of any written draft—be it an email, a chat message, or a formal document. It solves the common problem of tone mismatch by leveraging the Google Gemini API to offer multiple, high-quality rewrites in a single, efficient process.

This project serves as an excellent portfolio piece, showcasing skills in modern React development, smooth UI/UX design (using Tailwind CSS), robust API integration, and efficient structured data handling.

✨ Key Features

This application uses a single user input to generate multiple distinct outputs, providing instant communication flexibility.

Professional Tone: Rewrites the draft for formal communication, ensuring clarity, politeness, and adherence to business etiquette.

Friendly Tone: Creates a casual, approachable, and warm version suitable for internal team communications or close colleagues.

Concise Tone: Distills the message down to its core point, eliminating jargon and unnecessary phrasing for maximum brevity.

Custom Tone (Advanced Feature): Allows the user to define any tone imaginable (e.g., "Sarcastic," "Like a Pirate," "Academic," or "Excited"). This dynamic feature demonstrates the flexibility of the underlying LLM integration.

Instant Feedback UI: Features smooth loading states and a one-click copy function for instant use.
